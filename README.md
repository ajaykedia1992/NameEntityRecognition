# NameEntityRecognition
This project is based on NER using BERT built on Keras and Tensorflow

# Description 
Named Entity Recognition is a technique to identity and classify the named entities in the text. These entities can be pre-defined and generic like location names, organizations, time and etc, or they can be very specific like the example with the resume. There are large number of companies are using NER in their application and its use cases are well known around the world. Applications of NER include: extracting important named entities from legal, financial, and medical documents, classifying content for news providers, improving the search algorithms, and etc.

# Deep Learning Approach to NER
In this project, I used BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which is a new method of pre-training language representations which obtains state-of-the-art results on a wide array of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. You can find information about the BERT on [Google AI Blog!](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html).
